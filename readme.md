## QnA
- Why is the entire repo/code in english ?
    - It's because in a real project, we have a higher chance to use english over french
- Why use vue instead of vite like we saw in classe ?
    - Because im more used to vue instead of vite, and the teacher said that we could use react for example if we are more experienced with it.
    - Because I want vue router.
- Did I used any form of AI ?
    - Yes, but for minor issue fix / easier time at refactoring code (faster) / code overhauls
